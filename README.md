# crystalcoke

A really stupid and kinda dank CLI as a "practical" project for Crystal.

## Installation

Download the script in bin/\\
???\\
Run it (probably only works on linux)\\

If you are on any other platform you can build the project yourself on Crystal.\\
Just install it at <https://crystal-lang.org/install/>, download the repo and run `crystal build src/crystalcoke.cr`.\\
Congrats, you now built an executable! Run it. It should be in the root directory.
