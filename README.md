# Crystalcoke

A really stupid and kinda dank CLI as a "practical" project for Crystal.  
This is more or less the better and up to date version of [MCI](https://github.com/Terminalfreaks/MCI), which is another CLI which does similar to the same things that this does.  

## Installation

Download the script in bin/  
???  
Run it (probably only works on linux)  

If you are on any other platform you can build the project yourself on Crystal.  
Just install it at <https://crystal-lang.org/install/>, download the repo and run `shards build`.  
Congrats, you now built an executable! Run it. It should be in the bin directory.

## Usage

To see available commands, run `crystalcoke --help`
